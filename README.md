# nuxt-example

> An example project built using Nuxt

Created as a demonstration for this [blog article](https://www.toptal.com/blog)

A static version of the site (made using `nuxt generate` is hosted [here](https://nuxt-example.netlify.com/)

Why not clone this repo and try it out yourself?

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/BenShelton/nuxt-example.git
```

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install # Or 'yarn'

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
npm run build
npm start

# generate static project
npm run generate
```
